    <dd>Be it clipped vocals, ever-lingering guitar strums, or intimate studio banter, the rawness of Zach Bryan is the
        only way that any of these songs would have made sense. He simply gives his reflections and stories space to
        breathe. The first half of Zach Bryan is easily its more consistent side.

    <dd>It's foggy, lo-fi, and predominantly acoustic. There are times when you'll have to fight through the bedroom
        production to get at the heart of a song [...] but one worth waging for the few who have the patience to endure
        eighteen straight acoustic Americana ballads"

    <dd>This album has some really high highs, and I think it's one of the better country albums released this decade. I
        think there are a few too many songs that don't quite live up to the best ones, but it's a really great
        collection of songs that delves deep into Zach's style of country music.
