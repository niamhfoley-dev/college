    <dt>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</dt>
    <dd>TCP is a popular communication protocol which is used for communicating over a network. It divides any message
        into series of packets that are sent from source to destination and there it gets reassembled at the
        destination.
    </dd>
    <dt>Internet Protocol (IP)</dt>
    <dd>IP is designed explicitly as addressing protocol. It is mostly used with TCP. The IP addresses in packets help
        in routing them through different nodes in a network until it reaches the destination system. TCP/IP is the most
        popular protocol connecting the networks.
    </dd>
    <dt>User Datagram Protocol (UDP):</dt>
    <dd>UDP is a substitute communication protocol to Transmission Control Protocol implemented primarily for creating
        loss-tolerating and low-latency linking between different applications.
